          <code></code>
          <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a method used to build websites that automatically adjust their layout and content to fit different screen sizes and devices. Whether you're browsing on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop monitor, the site remains visually appealing and easy to use without requiring zooming or horizontal scrolling.</p>
          <p>This is achieved through a combination of flexible layouts, fluid grids, and media queries in CSS. Instead of designing separate websites for each device type, developers create a single design that adapts to the available screen space.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Responsive design creates one website that works seamlessly across all devices.</li>
          </ul>

             <header>The Importance of Mobile_First Design</header>
             <code></code>
             <p>Mobile-first design is an approach where you begin designing for the smallest screens first, then progressively enhance the experience for larger devices. This ensures that essential features and content are prioritized for users who are often on the move and may have limited data or screen space.</p>
          <p>Designing mobile-first forces developers to focus on performance, accessibility, and clarity, since these are most critical on smaller devices. Once the core content and layout are optimized for mobile, itâ€™s easier to scale up for tablets and desktops using media queries.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing mobile-first guarantees a better experience for the majority of users today.</li>
          </ul>

          <section id="Using_Media_Queries" class="main-section">
             <header>Using Media Queries</header>
             <code></code>
             <p>Media queries are a powerful CSS feature that allows you to apply different styles depending on the screen size, resolution, orientation, or even device type. For example, you might use one set of styles for screens smaller than 600px and another for screens wider than 900px.</p>
          <p>By combining media queries with flexible layouts, developers can ensure the website adapts fluidly, such as hiding a sidebar on smaller screens or increasing font sizes on larger displays. This ensures optimal readability and usability no matter the device.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Media queries make your CSS adaptable to different screen conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <section id="Flexible_Layouts_and_Units" class="main-section">
             <header> Flexible Layouts and Units</header>
             <code></code>
             <p>Instead of using fixed widths (like px), responsive layouts rely on flexible units like %, em, or rem. These units allow content to grow or shrink in proportion to the screen size, helping maintain a consistent layout and user experience.</p>
          <p>Modern CSS tools like Flexbox and Grid Layout make it easier to build complex responsive designs without relying on JavaScript. With these tools, you can easily align, space, and reorder items to suit different screen widths and orientations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flexible units and layout systems ensure your design can stretch or shrink as needed.</li>
          </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="Responsive_Images_and_Media" class="main-section">
             <header> Responsive Images and Media</header>
             <code></code>
             <p>Images play a big role in responsive design. If not managed properly, they can break layouts or slow down your website. Using CSS properties like max-width: 100% and height: auto allows images to resize within their containers without distortion.</p>
          <p>HTML also provides tools like the <picture> element and srcset attribute, which enable browsers to choose the best image file based on the device's screen size or resolution. This helps improve performance and provides better visual quality for all users.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Serve flexible, optimized images to avoid layout issues and improve performance.</li>
          </ul>
