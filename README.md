## What I Learned
- Structuring long-form content with semantic HTML (`nav`, `section`, `article`)
- Creating a fixed navigation bar that links to different sections
- Using anchor links for smooth navigation
- Presenting code snippets and technical text in a readable format
- Styling layout, spacing, and typography with CSS
